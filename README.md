# Project Overview:
In a highly competitive customer-driven market, retaining customers is crucial. This project focuses on understanding customer behavior, analyzing churn patterns, and predicting future churners.
We used SQL for deep data extraction and exploration, Power BI for insightful visualization, and Python with machine learning models to predict churn probabilities for newly joined customers.
The project predicts potential future churners among newly joined customers, allowing proactive retention strategies.
